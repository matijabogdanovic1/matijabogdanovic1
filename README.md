👨‍💻 My name is Matija Bogdanović, I am 20 years old #websitedesigner and I come from Serbia.

🌐 I have been engaged in website design for over 4 years and have extensive experience working with HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and WordPress.

💻 Throughout my career, I have designed over 80 websites for my local clients, friends, and have assisted numerous companies in resolving their coding issues.

🎯 I am highly motivated and for me, website design is primarily a pleasure, especially when I sit down at my desk to work.

🚀 Secondly, my goal is to help clients scale their businesses and enhance their online presence.

💡 I am always eager to take on new challenges and constantly strive to improve my skills.

🔥 My passion for website design drives me to deliver the best possible results for my clients.

📚 In my life, I’ve completed many courses and lessons on website design, both paid (where @naucidizajn on Instagram left the biggest impression on me) and free ones via StackOverflow, YouTube, and GitHub.

🖥️ I found myself between those lessons and my own way of designing.

👀 You'll understand better when you check out my projects.

🤝 Let's work together to bring your vision to life and achieve your business goals.
